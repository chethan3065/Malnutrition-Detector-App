# Malnutrition-Detector-App
This project is an AI-powered Android application designed for early screening of malnutrition in children under five years of age. The system automatically estimates Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) from a child’s image and combines it with anthropometric inputs such as height, weight, and age using deep learning fusion models. Built with Kotlin and PyTorch Mobile, the app runs entirely on-device for privacy and offline use. It classifies malnutrition risk levels and provides simple, village-friendly dietary advice and care recommendations, making it suitable for use by community health workers in low-resource and rural settings.

## Model Files
Trained PyTorch model files are not included in this repository due to size and security constraints.
